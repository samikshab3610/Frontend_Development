    <p>
        I’m an aspiring AI/ML Engineer and Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on building intelligent and
        efficient systems. Currently, I’m pursuing hands-on projects in Web Development, Data Structures & Algorithms,
        and Machine Learning to strengthen both my technical and problem-solving skills.
<br>
        I enjoy transforming ideas into real-world solutions — from creating responsive web apps using the MERN stack to
        optimizing models with data-driven insights. Beyond coding, I’m passionate about continuous learning, teamwork,
        and applying technology to make a tangible impact.
<br>
        I’m currently looking for opportunities that challenge my skills and let me contribute to meaningful projects in
        AI, Software Development, or Data Engineering.
